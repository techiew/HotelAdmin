# HotellAdmin
The extra L is not a typo!

This program provides an interface to a database which allows you to manage room reservations at a theoretical hotel, a potential use case scenario could be at the reception for the hotel. The database was also linked to a website, which was developed independently from this program. The website would allow potential customers to make a booking at the hotel. The website code is not included in this Github repo.

The database and whatnot is long gone so this program is not going to be runnable.

We got an A on this task :)

# HotelAdmin

![Preview](https://github.com/techiew/HotelAdmin/blob/master/preview.jpg)

This program provides an interface to a database which allows you to manage room reservations at a fictional hotel, a potential use case scenario could be at the reception for the hotel, where the receptionist would manage reservations. The same database was also linked to a website we made. The website was developed independently from this program, it would allow customers themselves to make a online booking at the hotel. The website code is not included in this repo.

The database and whatnot is long gone so this program is not going to be runnable.

We got an A on this task :).
